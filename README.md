Excursion Risk Simulation using Fractional Brownian Motion

The file contains a Fractional Brownian Motion and Brownian Motion class where you can compute delta excursion, local time, truncated variation (upcrossing and down crossing), and yet in progress on deriving the Hurst value using the given fractional brownian motion.
